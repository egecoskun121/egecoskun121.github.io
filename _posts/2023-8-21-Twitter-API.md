## Twitter for developers

In our upcoming project, we need to check our users' social media accounts.

So I decided to have an idea of Twitter API beforehand the task blows in my hand :).

Twitter has a very well documented API for developers.
And the API has some access levels we need to talk about:
* Free
* Basic
* Pro

In the free versions description it mentions that "For write-only use cases and testing the Twitter API."


Also, you can only post 1500 per month. Finally, we can only use this API with 1 app ID.

The Basic version has post 3000 per month, and you can use it with 2 different app IDs. It costs 100$.

Probably my company is going to go with the free version or basic version.

Like I said,
they have an exceptional documentation for the API and they have a Postman collection for you to try the endpoints.

Here you can find the Postman [collection](https://t.co/twitter-api-postman)
