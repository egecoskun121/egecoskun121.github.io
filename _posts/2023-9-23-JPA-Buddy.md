## JPA Buddy

Hello everyone,

In today's episode, I will mainly talk about JPA Buddy and how do I use it in my daily tasks.

Just found out JPA Buddy while working on a task, and it really boosts my productivity.

In their official documentation, they also state that this plugin intended to:

*Lower barrier to entry into development with JPA

*Boost developer's productivity

You can check out their official documentation from  [here](https://jpa-buddy.com/documentation/).

## How to use it?

If you are using IntelliJ, you can go to **Settings** -> **Plugins** and then download the **JPA Buddy** plugin. It may need a restart.

After downloading if you click on a file that ends with .java, the plugin appears on the right side right under the Maven tab.

I am new to JPA Buddy and still learning. In my first attempt just used it to **Create JPA entities from DB**.
When you have a DB design for all of your entities, its just boilerplate kinda code to write. I created the DB design for my entities and JPA Buddy created the entities for me.
You may want to double-check everything even though JPA Buddy works great :)

There are many features like this in JPA Buddy. Like creating JPA queries. I tried it, and it just makes creating queries so easy and effortless. 
Sometimes creating JPA queries can be complex with just namings. It visualizes creating queries and simplify that complexity, also you can see the outcome SQL query from it.

Probably I will be creating a new episode for JPA Buddy and try new features of it.

See you on next episodes.
